This is your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Uber.

A rule looks like this:

A NE B

This means this means point A is located northeast of point B.

A SW C

means that point A is southwest of C.

Given a list of rules, check if the sum of the rules validate. For example:

A N B
B NE C
C N A
does not validate, since A cannot be both north and south of C.

A NW B
A N B
is considered valid.

We will be sending the solution tomorrow, along with tomorrow's question. As always, feel free to shoot us an email if there's anything we can help with.

Have a great day!
